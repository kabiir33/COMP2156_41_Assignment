I love the Devops Courese Very much
Monitoring and Feedback: DevOps emphasizes monitoring application and infrastructure health in real-time, collecting metrics, logs, and other data to provide feedback loops for continuous improvement.
Collaboration: DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility.
Automation: Automation plays a crucial role in DevOps, enabling the continuous delivery and integration of code, as well as automating repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.
