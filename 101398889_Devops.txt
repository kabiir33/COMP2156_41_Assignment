Collaboration: DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility.
Automation: Automation plays a crucial role in DevOps, enabling the continuous delivery and integration of code, as well as automating repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI is a practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, where automated builds and tests are run. This ensures that code changes are validated early and often, reducing integration issues.
Continuous Delivery (CD): CD extends CI by automating the deployment process, allowing teams to release software updates to production quickly, safely, and sustainably. CD pipelines automate the entire delivery process, from code commit to production deployment.
