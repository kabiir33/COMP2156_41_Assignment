DevOps practices promote resource optimization and cost reduction by enabling engineers to automate resource provisioning, scale infrastructure based on demand, and identify and eliminate inefficiencies in the development and deployment process.
By leveraging cloud computing services and containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, engineers can build resilient and elastic architectures that can handle varying workloads efficiently.
